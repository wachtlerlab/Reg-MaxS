Reg-MaxS : Registration of neuron morphologies based on maximization of spatial overlap

This algorithm applies scalings, translations and rotations to maximize the spatial overlap between two morphologies.

Another algorithm, Reg-MaxS-N, which is based on Reg-MaxS, does the same for groups of morphologies.

The algorithms are written in  Python and at the moment work only with SWC files.
